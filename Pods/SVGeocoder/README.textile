__*Important note if your project doesn't use ARC*: you must add the @-fobjc-arc@ compiler flag to @SVGeocoder.m@ and @SVPlacemark.m@ in Target Settings > Build Phases > Compile Sources.__

h1. SVGeocoder

SVGeocoder is a simple Cocoa wrapper for the "Google Geocoding Service":http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/geocoding/. It allows you to quickly geocode and reverse-geocode addresses and coordinates. It is blocked-based, uses @NSURLConnection@, ARC, as well as @NSJSONSerialization@ to automatically parse JSON responses (making it only compatible with iOS 5+). Make sure you read the Google Geocoding Service "Terms of Service":http://code.google.com/apis/maps/terms.html#section_10_12 before using SVGeocoder. 

h2. Installation

* Drag the @SVGeocoder/SVGeocoder@ folder into your project. 
* Add the *CoreLocation*, *MapKit* and frameworks to your project.

h2. Usage

h3. Using the Geocoding API

In it's simplest form, geocoding an address is as simple as:

<pre>
[SVGeocoder geocode:addressField.text
         completion:^(NSArray *placemarks, NSHTTPURLResponse *urlResponse, NSError *error) {
             // do something with placemarks, handle errors
         }];
</pre>

Where @placemarks@ is an array of @SVPlacemark@ objects (see more about that below). 

Additionally, you can use Google Geocoding API's @region@ parameter to fine-tune your search:

<pre>
+ (SVGeocoder*)geocode:(NSString *)address bounds:(MKCoordinateRegion)bounds completion:(SVGeocoderCompletionHandler)block;
+ (SVGeocoder*)geocode:(NSString *)address region:(CLRegion *)region completion:(SVGeocoderCompletionHandler)block;
</pre>

h3. Using the Reverse Geocoding API

<pre>
[SVGeocoder reverseGeocode:CLLocationCoordinate2DMake(45.53264, -73.60518)
                completion:^(NSArray *placemarks, NSHTTPURLResponse *urlResponse, NSError *error) {
                    // do something with placemarks, handle errors
                }];
</pre>

h2. About the SVPlacemark object

SVPlacemark is now a simple NSObject. Here's a sample placemark returned for string "3456 Saint-Denis, Montreal":

<pre>
{
    ISOcountryCode = CA;
    administrativeArea = Quebec;
    coordinate = "45.517363, -73.568376";
    country = Canada;
    formattedAddress = "3456 Rue Saint-Denis, Montreal, QC H2X 3L1, Canada";
    locality = Montreal;
    postalCode = "H2X 3L1";
    subAdministrativeArea = "Communaut\U00e9-Urbaine-de-Montr\U00e9al";
    subLocality = "Le Plateau-Mont-Royal";
    subThoroughfare = 3456;
    thoroughfare = "Rue Saint-Denis";
}
</pre>

There's also a @region@ (@MKCoordinateRegion@) property in case the returned placemark isn't a pinned location, and a @location@ (@CLLocation@) convenience property.
